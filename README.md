# SPI-color-display-with-2D-and-3D-graphics

Design, implementation and testing for the graphics engine prototype for LPC 1769 using a 128x160 LCD TFT display.

The goal is to display a 3D world coordinate system and then three 3D cubes with the forest pattern on one surface, Square screensaver
pattern on the second surface and the initial of the user on the third surface, where each cube is at a different position, of different size and rotated at a different angle.

The main objective of this work is to display tree pattern and a 3D cube and understand the communication between the LPC module and LCD module. The implementation of SPI interface has the following objectives:

1. Understanding of LPC 1769, LCD TFT color display, 7805 IC.
2. Design and implementation of a power circuit for the LPC module.
3. Practical exposure with LPCXpresso IDE.
4. Inclusion of a graphical engine in the prototype board.
5. Learning 3D Vector graphics and the corresponding C code to implement this work.
6. Designing, implementing, testing and debugging CPU, LCD and other components.
